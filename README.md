# ðŸ”¥ ScratchGPT â€“ Build Your Own GPT from the Ground Up

ScratchGPT is a fully from-scratch implementation of a GPT-style transformer in PyTorch. 
It includes a character-level tokenizer, positional embeddings, self-attention mechanism, and a walkthrough notebook for learning.

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Custom character-level tokenizer
- Token + positional embeddings
- Scaled dot-product self-attention
- Fully annotated Jupyter notebook
- MIT License â€“ use it, remix it, learn from it

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install torch`
3. Run `main.ipynb` to step through the build

## ðŸ§  Why?
To learn the internals of GPT models and transformers, without using high-level libraries like Hugging Face.
